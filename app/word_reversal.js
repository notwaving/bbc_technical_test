// A need has been identified for a function that can reverse words within a string but leaving them in the same order just the letters reversed to support testing of Arabic output on BBC News. Remember to: Reverse the words within the string but not the order of the words.
// The input to the function would be string of N characters in length â€“ the string only consists of lowercase letters (a-z) and space and the output is the words reversed. The input string will contain one or more words of varying lengths.

// Write a function that can reverse words within a string, but NOT the order of the words

// Strings are immutable so all changes need to be made into an array first

// Reversing everything in the array will return a reversed order of words too.
// Split this reversed stting by spaces, so we can isolate each word in an array, reverse each word and join() to return the result as a string to the user

// Call the function.
