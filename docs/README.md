# BBC Technical Test - Word Reversal

This function was written within a Node environment, using Jest for testing.There are two ways to interact with my solution:

## Quicker
1. Go to app/word_reversal.js, paste lines 8-12 and test in repl.it, or equivalent.

## Slower
2. Clone this repo, get the dependencies with `npm install`, and change the `console.log()` in line 12 to test different strings. In terminal, run:

`node app/word_reversal.js`

to print the solution to screen.
